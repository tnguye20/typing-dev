# Typing Dev
A <a href="https://type-dev-5e193.web.app/" target="_blank">Typing Practice</a>
 Web App built entirely in React
<br />
<br />

# Motivation
Typical typing softwares utilize generic passages to construct their lessons. Although one can improve using such contents, programmers may find it less effective due to the nature of the phrases and characters that they use in their day-to-day (ex: all the brackets and those annoying semicolons).   
 
Typing Dev is designed to solve that problem, by pulling in quality code across Github and put them at your fingertips. The process is designed to efficiently get the files that match the language you indicate.

# Note
Due to the rate limit of the Github Search API, reloading the page multiple time to get new code/projects is not ideal. However, I have implemented a cache to pull past code's URL and fetch the file to ensure the state of the content and avoid abusing the limit.
